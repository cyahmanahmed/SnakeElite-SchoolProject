# 🐍 Snake Elite — Advanced Pygame Project

**Course Project | May 2025**  
**Module:** Programming Fundamentals / Game Development  
**Language:** Python  
**Framework:** Pygame  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Snake Elite** is a feature-rich, arcade-style Snake game developed in **Python using Pygame** as part of an academic programming project completed in **May 2025**.  

The objective of this project was to demonstrate a strong understanding of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Game loop architecture
- Event handling
- State management
- Algorithmic logic (maze generation)
- Clean, maintainable code structure

The project expands upon the traditional Snake game by introducing **multiple game modes, dynamic menus, themes, skins, and procedurally generated maze missions**.

## 🎯 Academic Project Requirements

According to the project brief, students were required to:

- Design and implement a **fully functional game** using Python
- Apply **object-oriented design principles**
- Use **external libraries** responsibly (Pygame)
- Implement **multiple game states** (menus, gameplay, pause, game over)
- Include **player interaction via keyboard and mouse**
- Extend the base game with **custom features** beyond a standard Snake implementation
- Produce **clean, readable, and well-documented code**
- Deliver a **complete, playable application**

Snake Elite was developed to meet **all required criteria**, while adding several advanced features beyond the minimum scope.
